#t - time to complete plan
#n - number of servers active at the end of the plan
#c - cost per second at the end of the plan
#r - responses handled by the system per second at the end of the plan
#d - dimmed responses handled at the end of the plan
#f - non-dimmed responses handled at the end of the plan
#i - gross income of the system configuration at the end of the plan
#p - profit
#q - quality, num normal users / num total users
#a - latency 1 / (handleable - incoming)
#s - penalizing same trees on both sides of an if then (meaning if 
 	the action succeeds or fails still do the same thing) this is 
 	the number that occur
#l - minimize plan length
#example objective string: rql - evaluate based on response time, quality, and plan length
