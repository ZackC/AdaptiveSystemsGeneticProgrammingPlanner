Possible Evaluations:

General Ideas:

Compare planner to PRISM planner to demonstrate the benefits of stochastic
search for planning:
- show that we can handle larger plans - this one seems straight forward; we
  should just measure how larger of plans each planner can create
- show that we can produce plans faster without much optimailty loss;
  generate plans with prism and the GA and measure how close we are to the
  optimal solution for those plans

Understand the GA:
- Explore the convergence of objectives over generations
- Explore different parameter settings to determine which are optimal
- Look into cases of interesting emergent behavior from earlier experiments

Explore new possibilities with the technique:
- combine plans which focus on different goals - for example, can we combine
  a plan that optimizes for security with a plan that optimizes for
  performance without messing up the integrity of the plans past a reasonable
  point; for example, maybe security is degraded slightly but it is still
  vastly improved
- upgrade plans after a system update; say that the plans are designed for a
  certain configuration.  Can we update the plans when new possible tactics are
  added to the system with less effort than completely regenerating the
  plans? or can we at least determine in which cases effort will be saved?
- if the quality requirements change (the fitness function), can we adjust the
  plans in a way that we don't have to spend the whole cost of recreating each
  plan from scratch?
- can we handle new treats to the system?; similar to the system update but
  when a new security vulnerability becomes known; or can we find new
  security vulnerabilities before they are executed?
- can we evolve tactics; start with the simple goal of optimizing certain
  statements, such as determining the correct threshold to react to a situation;
  eventually determine if it would be possible to experiment with the system
  in some way to create new tactics; maybe combining tactics in some way that
  produce a greater result than they would individually
